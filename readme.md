1. Build project:

    make all

2. Run project:

    ./bin/seq
    ./bin/gen 10 3

3. Algorithm description:

    - begin at P randomly selected oligonucleotides.
    - run algorithm locally until you generate some set of
        oligonucleotides of 2k.
    - repeat until you get oligonucleotides of length C.
    - use on of length C as a new spectrum S2.
    - run the basic algorithm based on S2 spectrum.
